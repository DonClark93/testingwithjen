/*
This is a rundown of using git
Git is a version control system
you invoke the git program by using the key word "git", then telling it the command that you you it to execute
there is usually(but not always!) a secondary or third argument that you also pass. This could be many things. you will see examples
there are 4 main commands that you will need to use

1. " git add . "
git - invoking the program 
add - the command that you are executing i.e. add new files, folders to the git version control system. 
you can also add changes to files already under the git version control system
. - this is the secondary argument, this is another way of saying "all files" otherwise you could git add each file individually

2. " git commit -m "MESSAGE" "
git - invoking the program 
commit - you want to commit these changes to the digital record that you are controlling
-m - a flag that states you wan to leave a message with this commit
"MESSAGE" - whatever you want, but keep it concise

3. " git push "
git - invoking the program
push - push a copy of the commits/records to the remote repostory for shared record keeping
**run this at the end of your session when you want to "save" your progress to the online repo 

4. " git pull "
git - invoking the program
push - pull a copy of the commits/records to the remote repostory for shared keeping
**run this at the beginning of your session to pull down changes that may not have yet - wont need to likely do this often

Think of it this way:
    you PULL down changes from the remote repo
    you ADD files to the stage
    you COMMIT the changes to the record
    you PUSH your record to the remote repo

So add something between the curly brackets and use the git commands to add, commit, and push! 
{
this is my addition to the file

}
